Abstract
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Message Passing Interface (MPI) has become the de facto way of 
implementing High Performance Computing (HPC) applications as it 
provides library routines to satisfy virtually all communication 
patterns. The goal of our research is to understand performance 
characteristics of parallel programs written in Java versions of MPI. 
Two such MPI libraries exist, i.e. OpenMPI and FastMPJ. The team will 
be testing performance of our applications based on both these frameworks. 
The algorithms that the team will be measuring are a complex and O(N^2) 
complexities. The team needs to make sure they run in an optimal fashion 
and give us the best results. The other aspect to our project is to develop 
some sample MPI Java programs.

Keywords:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
MPI, Java, Linux, Pairwise Cluster, FutureGRID, BIG RED2

Problem
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In our project we want to run the performance of MPI Java.  Then put the
results of the performance of MPI Java into an Excel sheet.  Lastly we 
will create a graph to display our results.


Design
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Project done in Linux Command-Line and Java

Week 1
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Progress:

* Learned Linux command-line
* Learned Java
* Learned the purpose and importance of our projects

Problems:

* No problems

Plans:

* To begin installing and running the MPI program and other programs
 
Week 2
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Progress:
 * Installed MPI 
 * Did MPI Sample
 * Wrote Abstract
 * Made FutureGRID account
Problems:
 * No problems, but didn't install MPI on FutureGRID
Plans:
 * Install and run MPI on FutureGRID
 * Create Sample MPI program
