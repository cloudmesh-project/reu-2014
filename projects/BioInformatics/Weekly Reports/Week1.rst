Week 1: 6/6/2014
=========================================================================

Done This Week:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thus far, I have determined what project I will be working on: I will be studying and processing genomics data, specifically fungi genome sequences, and trying to create an accurate visualization of the relationship between the different sequences.

Over the past few days, I have been studying up on using PlotViz, a visualization tool, understanding Map-Reduce, MPI (Message Passing Interface), phylogenetic trees, multi-dimensional scaling, and clustering. Also, I have been spending time studying the past results and documents produced by Dr. Fox and his team on genomics analysis. 

I have worked with Saliya Ekenayake to set up and deploy the Pairwise Clustering tool on the “R2” genomic data.

Also, I have begun setting up accounts in order to work with Yang Ruan in processing new genomic “D1” data through the Twister pipeline.

I spoke with Saliya about a potential shift in the scope of my project towards developing a system that would allow users to enter data through the internet and submit that data appropriately to the computer clusters that would process it. 

I begun moving forward with the "Twister" pipeline after establishing a FutureGrid account.

Uncompleted This Week:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have yet to run the Smith-Waterman algorithm on the new “D1” data in order to create a genomic distance matrix.

Also, I need to finish applying for and creating accounts for computer cluster access in order to run the algorithm mentioned above.

Solidify end goals of project in terms of what IU-SROC program expects. 

Next Week:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Complete account creation/general setup if any remains.
Begin processing genomic data through Twister Pipeline. I need to document the process! Or at least maintain notes of the steps involved.

Update goals and next steps for project. Determine what I will actually be doing.
