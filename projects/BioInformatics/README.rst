Problem
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Currently, Dr. Fox and his team have developed methods for processing, analyzing, and mapping genomic sequence data. Dr. Fox's team has received new data which needs to be processed and analyzed. 

 However, these processes and methods are incredibly heuristic and prone to error. There methods in place are constantly subject to tweaking and fine tuning. Also, the tools and processes in place are currently understood only by a few. 


Design
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Essentially, I will work with Saliya Ekenayake, Yang Ruan, and Dr. Geoffrey Fox in order to analyze and process the new data and develop a 3D relational-mapping of the data. 

Furthermore, I will seek to develop a system which would allow users to communicate their data to tools which would more efficiently process the data on computer clusters and produce useful output for the users.
