Problem
----------------------------------------------------------------------

First week
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The challenges of the first week of the program was to learn Python in
just some days and learn Linux commands to know how to use Ubuntu.
Besides to learn Python and Linux commands I had to read and
understand docopt and have a basic knowledge about mongodb/
mongoengine.



Design

Implementation
----------------------------------------------------------------------

First week
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This project I am working has being implemented in Python and using
mongoengine as database management.  It's function is to see what
resources are avaliable to be used on cloud and make a reservation of
this resource.  It has to validate if the time requested its avaliable
and return if the reservation is possible or not. And if not, it has
to say what is the next time this particular resource will be
avaliable for the solicited amout of time.
