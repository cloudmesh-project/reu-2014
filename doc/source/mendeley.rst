Hi! My name is Tatyana Matthews and I am here to provide you with a short and yet informative overview of Mendeley, a tutorial for getting started and additional resources for any help you may need.

Let’s get started!

What is Mendeley to begin with?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
* Mendeley is an open and “free reference manager” as well as “social network” that allows you to “organize research”, work collectively with others, and uncover the latest research as well.

* Menedely has many great features for its users:

  - Drag & Drop option for research papers
  
    * Mendeley will extract vital information from papers for you to further your organization i.e. title, journal, author, and keywords
    
  - Sync option
  
    * Use your mobile device and other computing devices to sync your research
    
    * Do everything on the go!
    
  - Groups option
  
    * You can create private groups in which you can share papers only within that private circle
    
    * You can also join public groups to link yourself with research from around the globe
