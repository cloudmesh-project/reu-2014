Research Experience for Undergraduates
======================================================================

This Web page is published at:

* http://cloudmesh.github.io/reu

This repository is for coordinating the activities done as part of the
Summer REU 2014.

Each student team will maintain a page in which the team reports:

* What has been done this week?
* What has been not achieved this week?
* What is planed for next week?

Additionally you may want to think and answer the following:

* How did the work this week help achieve the overal goal?

  * How did it contribute to the ppt?
  * How did it contribute to the poster?
  * How did it contribute to the 2-4 page paper?
  * How did it contribute to the code?
  * How did it contribute to the code documentation?

Agile Project Management
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Although you have a general topic assigned to you, we will be
practicing some agile project management. We will be meeting early in
the morning and identify what tasks there are for the day in case you
are unclear what needs to be done. The meeting will last not more than
10 minutes for the entire team.

Technical Skills
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You will have to learn a number of technical and general skills
quickly to effectively collaborate in a group. This includes the
following:

* Get a google account and use it throughout the REU, if you already
  have one, you can use it. Reason: We will be using google hangout
  and google docs

* Get a github.com account and put a unique Avatar in github. Collect
  as a group all github account names and send a single e-mail to
  Gregor so he adds you to this github directory

Week 1
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Goals:

* identify project
* learn python, git, interact with this github
* get familiarized with the project
* **draft** an initial project description
* **draft** an initial presentation to be given Friday in a group meeting
* add pages to this RST
* get an account on portal.futuregrid.org
* learn RST in an hour or less
