BioInformatics: Genomic Sequence Analysis
======================================================================

Problem
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently, Dr. Fox and his team have developed methods for processing,
analyzing, and mapping genomic sequence data. Dr. Fox's team has
received new data which needs to be processed and analyzed.

However, these processes and methods are incredibly heuristic and
prone to error. There methods in place are constantly subject to
tweaking and fine tuning. Also, the tools and processes in place are
currently understood only by a few.


Design
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Essentially, I will work with Saliya Ekenayake, Yang Ruan, and
Dr. Geoffrey Fox in order to analyze and process the new data and
develop a 3D relational-mapping of the data.

Furthermore, I will seek to develop a system which would allow users
to communicate their data to tools which would more efficiently
process the data on computer clusters and produce useful output for
the users.

Week 1: 6/6/2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Done This Week:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Determined what project I will be working on:
	-Studying and processing genomics data, specifically fungi 
		genome sequences, and trying to create an accurate 
		visualization of the relationship between the 
		different sequences.

- Studied up on using PlotViz, a visualization tool
- Studied Map-Reduce, MPI (Message Passing Interface), 
	phylogenetic trees, multi-dimensional scaling, and
	clustering. 
- Spent time studying the past results and documents produced by 
	Dr. Fox and his team on genomics analysis.

- Worked with Saliya Ekenayake to set up and deploy the Pairwise
	Clustering tool on the “R2” genomic data.

- Began setting up accounts in order to work with Yang Ruan
	in processing new genomic “D1” data through the Twister 
	pipeline.

- Spoke with Saliya about a potential shift in the scope of my 
	project	towards developing a system that would allow users
	to enter data through the internet and submit that data 
	appropriately to the computer clusters that would process
	it.

- Began moving forward with the "Twister" pipeline after establishing
	a FutureGrid account.

Uncompleted This Week:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Run the Smith-Waterman algorithm on the new “D1” data in
	order to create a genomic distance matrix.

- Need to finish applying for and creating accounts for computer
	cluster access in order to run the algorithm mentioned above.

- Solidify end goals of project in terms of what IU-SROC program
	expects.

Next Week:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Complete account creation/general setup if any remains.  
- Begin processing genomic data through Twister Pipeline. I need to document
	the process! Or at least maintain notes of the steps involved.

- Update goals and next steps for project. Determine what I will
actually be doing.
