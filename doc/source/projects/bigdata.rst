Problem
----------------------------------------------------------------------

How can a substantial amount of open source software packages
successfully be installed and tested on FutureGrid machines and later
made attainable utilizing the beneficial platform named Chef?

Ultimately, how can such a process and course of action contribute to
the evolution of innovation in the big data field?

Abstract
----------------------------------------------------------------------
As the amount of data generated around the world continues to accelerate by the second,
the more the term Big Data finds its way into scientific conversation. Because of this
tremendous surge, it has become imperative that such mass data use “computing power and
space” for it to be processed, analyzed, and serve other purposes [1]. Hence, in order
to meet head-on the enormous challenges rendered by Big Data, open source software from
the Apache Foundation is evaluated as a “Big Data Stack” to support scientific computing.
The approach to handling the complications surrounding Big Data involve installing and testing
as many open-source software packages from the Apache Big Data Stack as possible on FutureGrid
machines and later making those packages accessible utilizing Chef. The packages will be built
into projects and from that point Chef will be used to transform the infrastructure of each
project’s code, making it agile and accessible through a network of servers [2]. Essentially,
this research will demonstrate how the Apache Big Data Stack can be used and applied to solve
complex problems regarding Big Data.
