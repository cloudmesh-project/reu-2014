Week 1:

Progress:

During this week I was tasked with installing the PlotViz software and building the libraries used for it into my system. I also
made a futuregrid account and joined the project that I am currently in.

Problems:

I wasn't able to fully build the libraries this week because I didn't have salsadev svn access.

Plans:

Next week I plan on finishing up the building process for PlotViz and begin learning how to work the software.
