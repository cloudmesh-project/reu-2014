Evaluating the Performance of MPi Java in FutureGrid and Big Red2

Mentor:  Saliya Ekanayake

Team Members: Tori Wilbon, Nigel Pugh


Message Passage Interface (MPI) has been the common choice among developers
when developing tightly coupled parallel High Performance Computing (HPC) applications. 
The goal of our research is to understand performance characteristics of parallel programs
written in Java versions of MPI. Two such MPI libraries exist, i.e. OpenMPI and FastMPJ.
We will evaluate the performance of two deterministically annealed clustering programs. 
These algorithms are of O(N^2) complexity and part of the study will be to understand configuration options 
that optimally runs them. In addition to measuring the performance we also focus on developing 
a set of sample applications, which will benefit the MPI Java community.

Keywords: MPI, Java, Linux, Pairwise Cluster, FutureGrid, Big Red2

Problem
----------------------------------------------------------------------

a) Testing Performance of MPI Program





Design 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of my project is to measure the preformance of MPI Java and record the results. We want to make sure that the programs are running in optimal fashion and giving the best results possible
