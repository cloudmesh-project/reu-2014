Abstract
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Evaluating the Performance of MPi Java in FutureGrid and Big Red2

Mentor:  Saliya Ekanayake

Team Members: Tori Wilbon, Nigel Pugh


Message Passage Interface (MPI) has been the common choice among developers when developing tightly coupled
parallel High Performance Computing (HPC) applications and the majority of such applications are based on
either C, C++ or Fortran. The recent advancement in processing big data, however, has brought attention
towards Java. Effort has also been put on Java's support for HPC with flavors of MPI such as OpenMPI Java
and FastMPJ. We evaluate these against native C based MPI on a set of micro-benchmarks from the standard
Ohio MicroBenchmark suite from Ohio State University. The results show a promising future with Java and MPI
for HPC applications.


Keywords: MPI , HPC, OpenMPI, FastMPJ, benchmark

Problem
----------------------------------------------------------------------

a) Testing Performance of MPI Program





Design 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of my project is to measure the preformance of MPI Java and record the results. We want to make sure that the programs are running in optimal fashion and giving the best results possible
