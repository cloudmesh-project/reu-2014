Abstract
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Message Passage Interface (MPI) has been the common choice among 
developers when developing tightly coupled parallel High Performance 
Computing (HPC) applications. The goal of our research is to understand
performance characteristics of parallel programs written in Java 
versions of MPI. Two such MPI libraries exist, i.e. OpenMPI and FastMPJ.
We will evaluate the performance of two deterministically annealed 
clustering programs. These algorithms are of O(N^2) complexity and part 
of the study will be to understand configuration options that optimally 
runs them. In addition to measuring the performance we also focus on 
developing a set of sample applications, which will benefit the MPI Java
community.


Problem
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In our project we want to run the performance of MPI Java.  Then put the
results of the performance of MPI Java into an Excel sheet.  Lastly we 
will create a graph to display our results.


Design
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This project will be done in the Linux Command-Line and the sample
programs will be done in MPI Java.  The results will be done in a 
Microsoft Excel sheet to display the results and charts.

Implementation
