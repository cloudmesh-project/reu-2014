Abstract
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Message Passage Interface (MPI) has been the common choice among developers when developing tightly coupled parallel High Performance Computing (HPC) applications and the majority of such applications are based on either C, C++ or Fortran. The recent advancement in processing big data, however, has brought attention towards Java. Effort has also been put on Java's support for HPC with flavors of MPI such as OpenMPI Java and FastMPJ. We evaluate these against native C based MPI on a set of micro-benchmarks from the standard Ohio MicroBenchmark suite from Ohio State University. The results show a promising future with Java and MPI for HPC applications.

Problem
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In our project we want to run the performance of MPI Java.  Then put the
results of the performance of MPI Java into an Excel sheet.  Lastly we 
will create a graph to display our results.


Design
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This project will be done in the Linux Command-Line and the sample
programs will be done in MPI Java.  The results will be done in a 
Microsoft Excel sheet to display the results and charts.  I have also
written Sample code that have not been finished but will be a future 
work.

Implementation
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Linux Command Line,
MPI,
Java,
Ohio Micro Benchmark,
Maven,
Microsoft Excel


Keywords:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
MPI , HPC, OpenMPI, FastMPJ, benchmark
